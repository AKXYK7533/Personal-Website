            <h3>Hi Everyone!</h3>

            <h1>I'm <span>Anousack<br></span>a Fronted Developer from Lao PDR</h1>

            <p> EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES FOR ME, IT’S NOT HAPPEN IN SCHOOL,
                 BUT IT HAPPENED BY MY HUNGER TO EARN SOME MONEY, WHEN THE SUMMER OF 
                 GRADE 12. I WENT FOR THE PART-TIME JOB. I WAS A WAITER IN THE SPIRIT 
                 HOUSE COCKTAIL BAR & RESTAURANT (FOREIGNER OWNER), 
                 I HAVE WORKED HERE FOR TWO MONTHS, IT WAS SO DIFFICULT AT THAT TIME 
                I WAS SO TIRED, I HAD TO RIDE A BIKE FOR AROUND 25 KILOMETERS AND I
                WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE 6 AM-3 PM, BUT IT GAVE ME ONE MILLION
                 EXPERIENCES TO WORK HERE AND UNDERSTAND THE REAL LIFE.</p>

            <p>  It was the whole day's work on Saturday. I did not study academic 
                subjects, but I did write about journaling on my iPhone. 
                I shared great conversations with friends who worried about me.
                They could see through my face. It could tell. I told them 
                I just wonder about my life. What should I do after graduation
                 from the University? I am capable of things but could be better
                  or more professional. I mean, 
                  I don’t know what I really should focus on. Although I tried many 
                  things, I still don’t know what to focus on. I read a lot of books 
                  about self-improvement. I have a Growth Mindset. I only need to 
                  decide what to focus on and keep doing that until it works and 
                  succeeds. </p>
